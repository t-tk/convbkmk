convbkmk is a tiny utility for making correct bookmarks in pdf files
typesetted by platex/uplatex with the hyperref package.
platex/uplatex + hyperref outputs data of bookmarks
in their internal encodings (EUC-JP, Shift_JIS or UTF-8).
On the other hand, the PostScript/PDF format requests that
the data is written in a certain syntax with UTF-16 or PDFDocEncoding.
Thus, data conversion is required to create correct bookmarks.
convbkmk provides a function of
the encoding conversion and formatting the bookmark data.

More information is within the convbkmk.rb with the RD format.
